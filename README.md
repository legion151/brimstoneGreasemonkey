# brimstoneGreasemonkey

Don't use this! If you read it and understand it, you may... however don't blame me for anything. This fiddles arround
with your localStorage... and overrides stuff without proofing much... be warned!
Allows to load and export charsheet data via buttons on brimstone.neocities.org - though.


## supports
 - firefox greasmonkey works
 - kiwi browser on android works 


## original site 
https://brimstone.neocities.org/charactersheet
